Favorite problems
- 2018 13 (minecarts)
- 2017 21 (expanding Conway, was elegant)
- 2022 21 (used eval trick to solve an equation)
- 2018 18 (cool Conway output -- try animating successive generations -- also try for 2015 18)

Other problems to revisit
- 2015 19 (part 2)
Seems to have an unusually variable input generation. My input cannot be solved by a simple approach almost like part 1's, but many people's, including a friend's and those of several bloggers, can. I landed on a stochastic approach but a pathfinding approach would be fun to revisit (as long as it had ways to pare down the combinatorial explosion that I experienced with a naive approach even when starting with the medicine and working towards shorter and shorter molecules).
- 2015 20 (find more efficient approach)
